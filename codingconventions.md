# Coding Conventions

+ Variable and function names written as camelCase
+ Global variables written in UPPERCASE
+ Constants (like PI) written in UPPERCASE
+ Always put spaces around operators ( = + - * / ), and after commas
+ Always use 4 spaces/tab for indentation of code blocks
+ Always end a simple statement with a semicolon
+ Put the opening bracket at the end of the first line
+ Use one space before the opening bracket

# General rules for object definitions

+ Do not add a comma after the last property-value pair
